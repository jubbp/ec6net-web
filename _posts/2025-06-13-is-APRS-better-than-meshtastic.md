While gearing up to test Meshtastic over the last couple of weeks, an interesting thought kept coming into my mind. Meashtastic seems very simlar to APRS messaging.

Which is better and why?

## APRS

- Requires an Amateur Radio license or private use frequency.
- 2m APRS has a range in the coastal areas of WA is typically more like 50-100km.
- APRS hardware is more expensive than Meshtastic equipment.
- All Amateur Radio communications must not be encrypted, including APRS messages.

## Meshtastic

- Does not require a license.
- Is "Long Range" actually long range? or is it long range based on the power output of the devices.
- Meshtastic nodes are generally cheaper than APRS capabile Ham Radios.
- Meshtastic communications are generally encrypted with a public key or they are privately encrypted with a user share key.

## Observations

- Neither technology is in active use in Western Australia. There are very few nodes/users and the ones that are there are making very little noise.

## Conclusions

It's  little early to say if APRS is better than Meshtastic at this early stage. Check back later for updated conclusions.
