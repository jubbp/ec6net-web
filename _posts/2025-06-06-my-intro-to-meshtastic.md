This week I received in the mail my first Meshtastic devices. Meshtatic has been the flavour of the month for the HAM youtubers in recent times and I thought it was time to take a look and see how usefull we cam make it.

## Hardware

I purchase a couple of Lilygo devices.

## Initial Setup

The initial setup was very simple. After finding that the meshtastic oftware would not connect to the older firmware that the nodes shipped with, I fired up chrome and visited the meshtatic webflasher. 5 minutes later I had working mesh node clients.

## Meshtastic Desert

Apparently I live in a Meshtastic desert. There are no nodes close to my home and from what I can tell, there are no nodes in the Bunbury area. I'll need to do some driving around with my t-beam node to see if I can stumble apon any other nodes.

## MQTT

Meshtastic uses MQTT to link nodes which may be geographically isolated from each other. I turned it on last night and immediately I was having nodes pop up from all over Australia.

More to come.....
