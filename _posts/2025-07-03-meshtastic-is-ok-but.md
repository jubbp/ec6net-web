Meshtastic seems like a great technology and in some use cases it excels.

But for me, Meshtastic is almost useless. There just isn’t the user base in my area to make it a viable alternative to APRS which while not having a huge user base, is much more usuable in the regional areas of Western Australia. 

After a few “war-driving” efforts, I found no other nodes in the Bunbury Area.

So the nodes are going into a box until Meshtastic gains some momentum locally. I’ll keep 1 node connected to MQTT to monitor traffic from my office but the other are consigned to the maybe sometime box.
