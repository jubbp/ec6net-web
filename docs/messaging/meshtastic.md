## Introduction

Meshtastic is an implementation of LORA radios for messaging and other telemetry.

Meshtastic does not require a license and so is available to many more people in our local neighbourhoods.

I have had no experience with meshtastic but have some devices on the way so will update this page with my experiences.

The Comms Channel have developed a BBS for meshtastic.

## Frequencies

Meshtastic devices are available in a selection of frequencies and you ensure your device works on the 915Mhz band for use in Australia
