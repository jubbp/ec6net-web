## Conductivity

### Conductors

A conductor is a material that allows electric current to flow through it easily.

It is a substance that permits electrons to move freely, enabling the transmission of electrical power or signals. 

Metals like copper and aluminum are common examples of electrical conductors.

### Semiconductors

A Semiconductor is a material with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like metal) and an insulator (like glass).

This means it can be made to conduct electricity under certain conditions, making it useful in electronic devices.

Common examples include silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide.

### Insulators

An electrical insulator is a material that resists the flow of electric current. 

Its atoms have tightly bound electrons that don't move freely, making it difficult for electricity to pass through.

Examples include rubber, plastic, and glass.

### Current, Voltage & Resistance

---

## Ohms Law

Ohm's Law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit.

It states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.

The formula is commonly expressed as V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

## Kirchoff's Laws

Kirchhoff's laws are two fundamental rules in electrical circuit analysis.

**Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)** states that the sum of currents entering a node (or junction) in a circuit is equal to the sum of currents leaving that node. This law is based on the principle of charge conservation.

I1 + I2 = I3

**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)** states that the sum of all voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero.

This law is based on the principle of energy conservation.

## Electrical Power

Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted.

It's measured in watts (W), where one watt is equal to one joule per second.

Electric power is crucial for understanding how quickly electrical devices use or supply energy.
