## Units of Measure


## Symbols

## Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power

Voltage is the measure of electrical pressure or potential difference between 2 points on a circuit

Current is a measure of the electron flow in a circuit

Resistance is the opposition to electron flow in a circuit.

Power is a measure of the energy consumed by a circuit.

| Measurement | Units | Abbreviation |
|—--|—--|---|
| Voltage | Volts | V |
| Current | Amps | A or I |
| Resistance | Ohms | R or Ω |
| Power | Watts | W or P |
| Frequency | Hertz | Hz |
| Wavelength | Metres | M or λ |



## Current

Current is the flow of electrons in a circuit. There are two types of current, Alternating Current and Direct Current.

### Direct Current

Direct Current is usually shortened to DC. In a DC circuit the flow of electrons is always from the negative power sounce towards the positive terminal of the power source.

### Alternating Current 

Alternating Current is usually shortened to AC. In an AC circuit the flow of electrons alternates at some frequency. For example, current flow in our mains AC power alternates at 50Hz or 50 cycles per second.



## Basic Circuit Symbols

One of the requirements of the Foundation qualification is the recognition of some basic component and radio circuit symbols. These are universal and will often appear within radio
manuals. Exam candidates should memorise these items.
