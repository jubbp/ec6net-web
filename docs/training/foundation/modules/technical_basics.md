## Symbols

## Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power

Voltage is the measure of electrical pressure or potential difference between 2 points on a circuit

Current is a measure of the electron flow in a circuit

Resistance 

## Current

Current is the flow of electrons in a circuit. There are two types of current, Alternating Current and Direct Current.

### Direct Current

Direct Current is usually shortened to DC. In a DC circuit the flow of electrons is always from the negative power sounce towards the positive terminal of the power source.

### Alternating Current 

Alternating Current is usually shortened to AC. In an AC circuit the flow of electrons alternates at some frequency. For example, current flow in our mains AC power alternates at 50Hz or 50 cycles per second.
