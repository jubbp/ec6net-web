## Harmful Interference

**TODO** Add description of harmful interference

Amateur Radio stations **must not** be operated in a way that causes harmful interference to **other licensed services**.

## Restriction of Operation

In the even that your station is identified as a source of hameful interference, the ACMA or its inspectors have the right to restrict you operations to avoid the interference.

>You should cease all operations until you can ensure that your station does not cause further interference. You would probably be in consultation with ACMA or an inspector to determine if you can resue operations.
