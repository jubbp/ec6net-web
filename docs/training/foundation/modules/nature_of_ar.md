## Nature of Amateur Radio

Amateur Radio is the use of radio spectrum to facilitate the hobby of radiocommunications.

## The Regulator

Along with Amateur Radio, the ACMA is responsible for all radio spectrum users. Other license types include:

- citizens band (CB),
- land mobile,
- point-to-point links and
- broadcasting.

The ACMA allocates specific bands for services such as, broadcasting, aeronautical and maritime. Each service has band(s) allocated to them that are appropriate for their use.

## License Conditions

Amateur Radio is authorised under the **Amateur Class License (2024)** and the **Amatuer LCD for Beacon and repeater stations**. Amateur stations are also subject the the conditions of the **Radiocommunications Act 1992**.

The purpose of the Amateur Class License is to facilitate *self-training in radiocommunications, communications between amateurs and technical investigations into radiocommunications technologies*.

Amateur class operators *are not permitted* to communicate with other radio users unless in relation to a distress or emergency situation.

Amateur class operators *may pass messages* on behalf of third parties as long as there is *no financial gain involved*.

### Primary and Secondary Allocations

When a band is allocated to Amateur use, they can be for Primary or Secondary use basis. 

A **Primary** use band is one which is solely for use by Amateur Radio operators.

A **Secondary** band is one which we share with another service on the basis that we do not cause any interference to the primary user.
