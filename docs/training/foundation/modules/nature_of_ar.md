## Nature of Amateur Radio

Amateur Radio is the use of radio spectrum to facilitate the hobby of radiocommunications.

## The Regulator

Amateur Radio in Australia is administered by the ACMA, The Australian Communications and Media Authority.

Along with Amateur Radio, the ACMA is responsible for all radio spectrum users. Other license types include:

- citizens band (CB),
- land mobile,
- point-to-point links and
- broadcasting.

The ACMA allocates specific bands for services such as, broadcasting, aeronautical and maritime. Each service has band(s) allocated to them that are appropriate for their use.

## License Conditions

Amateur Radio is authorised under the **Amateur Class License (2024)** and the **Amatuer LCD for Beacon and repeater stations**. Amateur stations are also subject the the conditions of the **Radiocommunications Act 1992**.

The purpose of the Amateur Class License is to facilitate *self-training in radiocommunications, communications between amateurs and technical investigations into radiocommunications technologies*.

Amateur class operators *are not permitted* to communicate with other radio users unless in relation to a distress or emergency situation.

Amateur class operators *may pass messages* on behalf of third parties as long as there is *no financial gain involved*.

## License Types

There are two license types in Amateur Radio

- a class license (the Radio Communications (Amateur Stations) Class License 2023) This is the license which allows you to operate a staion.
- assigned apparatus licenses
- - to operate a repeater
- - to operate a beacon

## Providing Documentation

The ACMA has the power to request information from an amteur, including evidence of their qualifications.

This request may come from a Radio inspector.

## Change of Contact Details

All operators must notify the Australia Communicatrion a Media Authority of any changes to your contact details.

You should also ensure the ACMA has you current email address. They use this address to reconfirm your call sign every 5 years.

## Authorised Frequencies and emissions

Amateur Radio allocated frequency bands and emission modes are documented in the **Radiocommunications Licence Conditions (Amateur Licence) Determination 2015**. Bands are allocated to the different license classes with more priviledges allocated to the high license classes.

## Financial Gain

Amateur radio stations must not be operated for financial gain. You may not use your amateur class license to make money or advertise products or services.

## Radio Spectrum

### Frequency Bands

The Radio Spectrum is decided into bands. Amateur Reaiod operators have bands allocate for their use across the entire radio spectrum.

![Frequency Bands](../assets/bands.jpeg)

### Allocation of Frequency Bands

Bands are allocated for many types of uses, such as Air Band or spot frequencies, such as CB radio channels.


### Primary and Secondary Allocations

When a band is allocated to Amateur use, they can be for Primary or Secondary use basis. There are also bands which are allocated for exclusive use

An **Exclusive** use band is allocated for the exclusive use of the nominated service. 

A **Primary** use band is one which is allocated for use by Amateur Radio operators and other user should not cause interference.

A **Secondary** band is one which we share with another services on the basis that we do not cause any interference to the primary user.

>While Amateur operators have allocation throughout the entire spectrum, most AR operations take place in the HF, VHF and UHF bands.

### Amateur Band Allocations

Within the frequency bands are bands allocated for Amateur use. These bands consist of 2 edge frequencies, between which and discrete frequency may be used

![20m Band](../assets/20m_band.jpeg)

Amateur transmissions are not only on spot freqenecies but takes up some spectrum either or both sides of that frequency.

The Mode used will adjust the bandwidth required for the transmission. A CW signal is relatively small compared with an SSB and AM signal.

> Amateurs must ensure that their signal is entirely within the allocated frequency band.

An AM signal on 7.100 Mhz will occupy the bands by from 7.097 to 7.103 Mhz because an AM signal is typically 6 Kilo Hertz wide centralised on the dial/spot frequency.


### Frequency and Wavelength

Amateurs generally refer to the bands by their wavelength rather than by the frequency. Many Amateurs build their own antennas and wavelength relates to the length of the antenna elements.  

|---|---|
| Band | Frequency Range |
|---|---|
| 160m | |
| 80m | 3.500MHz  |
| 40m | 7.000 MHz - 7.200 MHz |
| 20m | 14.000 MHz - 14.350 MHz |
| 15m | 21.000 MHz |
| 10m | 28.00 MHz - 29. |
| 6m | |
| 2m | |
| 70cm | |


## Sample Questions

Below are some sample questions you may encounter in your exam.


1. ** A Foundation Amateur operator who is operating Upper Side Band on Frequency 14.349 is:**  
  1.1 Operating within their license
  1.1 Operating too close to the band edge
  1.1 Operating outside of foundation priviledges
  1.1 All of the above
