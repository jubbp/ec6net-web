#### 1.1 Nature of Amateur Radio

- Recall that amateur radio is intended to facilitate the hobby of radiocommunications.

#### 1.2 Types of Licenses

- Recall that amateur radio activities are authorised under the Amateur Class Licence and the Amateur LCD for beacon and repeater stations. Other forms of licences authorise different types of radiocommunications, such as citizens band (CB), land mobile, point-to-point links and broadcasting.
- Recall that the amateur service operates on frequency bands allocated for amateur use. Recall that the amateur service shares some frequency bands with other services.

#### 1.3 Allocation of frequency bands

conditions in the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Amateur
Class Licence and the Amateur LCD for beacon and repeater
stations.

#### 2.2 Purpose of the amateur service

- Recall that the Amateur Class Licence primarily authorises the
operation of an amateur station for self-training in
radiocommunications, intercommunication between amateurs
and technical investigations into radiocommunications.

#### 2.3 Communications by amateur stations

- Recall that, except in relation to a distress or emergency
situation, or participating in emergency services operations
or training exercises, the Amateur Class Licence only
authorises amateur-to-amateur communications.

- Recall that messages may be passed-on on behalf of third
parties as long as they are not used for financial gain or
reward.

#### 2.5 Distress and urgency signals

- Recall that distress communications are signalled by the use
of ‘MAYDAY’ and that these communications have priority
over all other communications.
Recall that anyone hearing a ‘MAYDAY’ communication is
responsible for passing the information on to an appropriate
authority.
- Recall that some urgent situations not warranting the use of
‘MAYDAY’ are signalled by the use of ‘PAN-PAN’.
- Recall that these communications should receive priority and
should be reported to an appropriate authority.

beginning and end of a transmission and at least every
10 minutes during transmissions.
