## Unsorted Thoughts with nowhere else to go



## Traffic

What information will we need to pass between operators? Do we need any standard formats?

- Weather
- Road Conditions
- Wellbeing / Welfare
- Station Status
- Assitance Request
- Forward Message ??


## Automated Information gathering system

Can we gather information from operators and store for later retrieval using multiple transmission modes??

Solutions that may exist already
JS8Call monitor??
APRSd
Packet BBS
