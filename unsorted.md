## Unsorted Thoughts with nowhere else to go

## Traffic

What information will we need to pass between operators? Do we need any standard formats?

- Weather
- Road Conditions
- Wellbeing / Welfare
- Station Status
- Assitance Request
- Forward Message ??

## Automated Information gathering system

Can we gather information from operators and store for later retrieval using multiple transmission modes??

Solutions that may exist already

- JS8Call monitor??
- APRSd
- Packet BBS

## Pony Express

First off - find a new name.

The Pony Express is a method of moving people and equipment with no significant cost to any one member. Operators sign up to be part of the pony express and undertake to offer transport when required.

It won't be the quickest transport solution but free and unencumberred by rules/regulations.

### The Pony List

Users sign up to be part of the list. Those that make regular trips away from their home area can advertise the fact.

| Operator | Location | NESW Extents | Regular Trips |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tom | Bunbury | Myalup, Capel, Burekup | Weekly trips to Donnybrook |
| Roger | Eaton | Mandurah, Donnybrook, Capel | Daily Trips Eaton to Collie |
| Andrew | Eaton | Myalup/Harvey, Greenbushes, Capel | Daily trips to Greenbushes |

### RFT - Request for Transport

A Member of the net will issue a request for transport.

Two members of the list make contact and organise a meetup. The originating pony will contact the recieving pony with details and availability.
