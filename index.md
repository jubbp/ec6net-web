## Introduction to EC6Net

The EC6Net is a mutual assistance net for Amateur Radio Operators in VK6.

Our aim is to build a community of trained operators who will come together in times of need to assist each other and our communities.

EC6Net is a decetralised organisation with no "controlling operator". The net is designed to function independantly or any one operator. Communication procedures take into account that communication can be needed at any time, with whoever may be available.

The sharing of information during an emergency if of utmost importance.

The tools for sharing information are many and varied in Amateur Radio and learning and training are an important part of being a member of the EC6Net community.
